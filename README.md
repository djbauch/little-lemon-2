# Little Lemon Website with React + TypeScript + Vite

I did not start the project with the deprecated Create React App. Instead I used a template that provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Also, I did all of my work in the TypeScript dialect, which is transpiled into EcmaScript by the Babel transpiler. The resulting EcmaScript is what the browser sees.

Make sure to use `npm i` to install the dependencies before running the program.

In addition, I used vitest and Storybook. To run unit tests, the command `npm run test` is used, as expected, and it works pretty much just like jest.

I used storybook, but it is currently only working on my Windows PC and not on my Mac. To start the Storybook tests, you can use `npm run storybook`

The images not provided by Coursera were generated using the Freepik AI image generator. Text and prices to go with those images for the food menu items were mostly autogenerated using github copilot. Github seems to have a particular fondness for garlic aioli!
